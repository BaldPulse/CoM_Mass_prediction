# CoM_Mass_prediction

This is a learning based approach to predict the CoM and mass of an object from an incomplete point cloud. The approach largely borrows from Contact-Grasp-Net https://github.com/NVlabs/contact_graspnet.

It is a subsystem of this [thesis](https://github.com/BaldPulse/Thesis). It is also used in [Multi-Modal Planning on Regrasping for Stable Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15283).

Trained with the ACRONYM dataset.
